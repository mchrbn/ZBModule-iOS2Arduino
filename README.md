# ZBModule-iOS2Arduino

iOS app to Arduino communication via LinkSprite's BLE Shield (http://learn.linksprite.com/arduino/shields/bluetooth-4-0-shield-for-arduino/) - a cheap BLE Shield you can find on TaoBao.

Couldn't find some good documentation for it. So here is a working example of code for both the iOS and Arduino parts.

## Note

If you have already an iOS project, you can simply add the Bluetooth class on your project.
